This library is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and was created for use in my game modding platform called Abendigo which you
can see here: [https://github.com/Jire/Abendigo](https://github.com/Jire/Abendigo)

This utility is used to scan the memory using byte-patterns to find the relative memory addresses for our cheat.

## Dependencies

- [Java-Memory-Manipulation](https://github.com/Jonatino/Java-Memory-Manipulation) as the foundation for memory reading/writing

## Plans

As of right now the project is currently not complete. The following are features I plan on adding:
 - Documentation
 - txt, xml, JSON: expect the ability to `dump` the offsets to a file format of your choice.
 - Support for Mac OSX, and other Unix based operating systems
